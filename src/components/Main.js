				<span className="image main">

				</span>
				<p>
					Filing an insurance claim can seem daunting depending on the scope of
					liability that is at stake. Generally, your insurance carrier holds
					the liability of certain structures on your property given a certain
					"peril" (tornado, fire, flood, etc) occurs. There are, however, a host
					of instances outlined in your policy where your carrier can deny
					coverage and legally refuse to accept liability under the basis that
					the damages do not fall within the parameters listed within the
					particular insurance policy.
					<br />
					<br />
					Because of this, carriers often enlist "experts" to inspect the
					damages who paint a particular picture as to the cause or extent of
					certain damages (usually the most expensive ones), and who provide a
					persuasive justification as to why these damages will not be covered.
					One such justification would be that the claimed peril did not cause
					the damage, but that the damage was "pre-existing."
					<br />
					<br />
					Many policy holders do not understand that these justifications are
					not black and white but are heavily influenced by the carrier's
					interest to escape the resposibility of an expensive liability.
					Additionally, most policy holders simply are not aware that they have
					options hidden in their policy that, when utilized, are
					highly-successful when combined with some patience and a couple
					industry experts.
					<br />
					<br />
					Capital Consultants provides general consultation services that will
					take into account your specific situation, and will advise you on the
					best course of action to take with your claim. Depending on your
					situation, we may assist in selecting certain necessary experts (such
					as public adjusters or appraisers) who we know have a history of
					succesfully negotiating insurance claims to a positive outcome.
					<br />
					<br />
					Our company exists to educate policy holders on their options and to
					provide assistance in making difficult decisions when facing a
					seemingly unbeatable opponent.

						<h4>Appraisals</h4>
					</li>{" "}
					<p className="indent">
						Appraisal is a process which effectively removes the checkbook from
						your carriers control and puts it into the hand of third party
						appraisers. In appraisal, both the policy holder and the carrier
						provide a third party appraiser to observe the damages and come to a
						conclusion about the cost of the the damages at question. This is an
						option oulined in almost every insurance policy and usually the
						outcome proves beneficial to the policy holder â”€ provided the policy
						holder hires a quality appraiser. Once both of the appraisers come
						to an agreement on the amount of the settlement as outlined by the
						particular insurance policy, the insurance carrier MUST pay that
						amount.
					</p>
					<li>
						<h4>Umpire Services</h4>
					</li>
					<p className="indent">
						In the event that the appraisers do not come to an agreement on the
						cost of the settlement of the claim, an umpire is selected to
						consider both appraisers estimates, and make the final decision on a
						fair settlement. In this case, both the policy holder and the
						carrier provide several candidates to act as an umpire. Once these
						candidates are provided, both parties must agree on only one umpire
						from the list of options. If the both parties do not come to an
						agreement on an umpire, a judge is appointed to make the umpire
						selection from the given pool. Once an umpire is appointed, he/she
						observes the damages and considers both appraisals and comes to a
						final conclusion about the final settlement that will be paid by the
						carrier. Just like with appraisal this decision is final and the
						carrier MUST pay.
					</p>
					<li>
						<h4>General Claim Consulting</h4>
					</li>
					<p className="indent">
						Capital Consultants' general consultation services offer access to
						our years of accumulated knowledge of the insurance claim industry
						that can help you correctly navigate your insurance claim to a
						desirable outcome. We will take into account your specific situation
						and advise you with clear and concise reasons on the best course of
						action to take regarding your claim. We also offer assistance in
						selecting certain necessary experts (such as public adjusters,
						appraisers, or umpires) who have a history of succesfully and
						professionally negotiating insurance claim disputes. In our
						experience, when a claim is filed, the biggest threat to policy
						holders is not a possible denial from their insurance carrier, but
						it is the understandable lack of familiarity with the complex
						process and an unawarness of highly-successful available options.
